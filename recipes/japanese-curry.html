    <h2>This is a recipe for Japanese Curry</h2>
    <p>If you've ever had Japanese curry rice from a take-away sushi store or at a Japanese restaurant, you'll know how incredibly delicious it is. Japanese curry is quite different from other curries from other places (like India). It is generally thicker and sweeter, so you must try it to taste the difference!</p>
    <p>Japanese curry rice is very easy to make and a very popular dish in Japan. Unlike other curries, Japanese people don't mix up all sorts of different spices, but use store bought curry roux. Because they are so popular, there are many different varieties of curry roux available in Japan.</p>
